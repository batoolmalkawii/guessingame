# guessingame
This is an _About-Me_ guessing game where the user has to guess facts about me. In this game, I ask the user eight questions described as follows:
1. To input his name, so that I can interact with him at a personal level.
2. To guess 5 facts about me. Then, I notify him with the correct answer.
3. To guess a random number and then notify him if his answer is correct or wrong.
4. To answer a question that accepts multiple options as an answer. The, show him all options.

At the end of the game, a **score** is displayed to the user, and the _HTML_ webpage shows two lists, a **Top 10 facts about me** list, and a **Background Education and Experiences** list.
